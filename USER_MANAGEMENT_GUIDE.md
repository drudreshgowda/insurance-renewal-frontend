## Developer Integration

### Using Permission Guards
```jsx
import PermissionGuard from '../components/common/PermissionGuard';

// Protect specific pages
<PermissionGuard permission="email-dashboard">
  <EmailDashboardButton />
</PermissionGuard>
```

### Using Permission Hooks
```jsx
import { usePermissions } from '../context/PermissionsContext';

const { hasPermission, canAccessRoute } = usePermissions();

// Check if user can access specific page
if (hasPermission('survey-designer')) {
  // Show survey designer features
}
```

## Security Features
- **Page-level protection**: Each route requires specific permission
- **Real page mapping**: Permissions directly correspond to actual application pages
- **Route validation**: Users cannot access pages they don't have permission for
- **Dynamic navigation**: Menu automatically adapts to user permissions
