# Development Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards

### 1. **Console Statements**
- Remove all `console.log()` statements before production
- Use proper logging libraries for production environments
- Replace debug statements with comments when appropriate

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Always wrap API calls in try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Use the ErrorBoundary component for React error handling
- Log errors appropriately (not to console in production)

### 3. **Security**
- **NEVER** use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### 4. **Performance**
- Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Implement proper loading states
- Avoid memory leaks by cleaning up useEffect hooks
- Optimize bundle size by removing unused imports

### 5. **Accessibility**
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Test with screen readers

### 6. **File Organization**
- Remove duplicate files
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize components logically
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ Removed Duplicate Files
- Deleted `src/pages/Case.jsx` (duplicate of `CaseDetails.jsx`)
- Cleaned up duplicate code in `Feedback.jsx`

### ✅ Security Improvements
- Added basic security styling to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- Added ErrorBoundary component for better error handling

### ✅ Code Quality
- Removed/commented 20+ console.log statements across multiple files
- Improved error handling in components
- Added proper loading states
- Fixed unused variable warnings in critical components
- Added ESLint configuration for better code quality

### ✅ Performance
- Added ErrorBoundary to prevent app crashes
- Improved error state management
- Reduced webpack bundle warnings significantly

### ✅ Build Optimization
- Reduced webpack warnings from 100+ to ~50
- Fixed critical unused imports in Layout.jsx and Dashboard.jsx
- Added proper parameter naming for unused arguments

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Add a proper logging service** (e.g., Winston, Pino)
2. **Implement HTML sanitization** (e.g., DOMPurify)
3. **Add unit tests** for critical components
4. **Set up ESLint rules** to catch these issues automatically
5. **Add TypeScript** for better type safety
6. **Implement proper state management** (Redux/Zustand) for complex state
7. **Add performance monitoring** (e.g., React DevTools Profiler)

## Testing Checklist
